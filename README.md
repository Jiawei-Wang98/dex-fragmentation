# ðŸ“‰ Dex Fragmentation

A model of a **competitive decentralized exchange (DEX) environment** where **liquidity providers** strategically minimize trading costs for **noise traders**, while accounting for the presence of **front-runners**. The equilibrium results in **multiple liquidity pools** with varying fee rates, depending on the composition of traders in each pool.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

- **Goal**: To understand how market fragmentation emerges endogenously in DEXs as a response to heterogeneous trader types and strategic LP behavior.

## ðŸ”§ Code

- The **simulation code** is available in this repository and allows replication of the theoretical model's predictions.
- The **empirical analysis** (based on blockchain transaction data) will be uploaded soon.

- Front-running & MEV  
- Pool fee optimization
